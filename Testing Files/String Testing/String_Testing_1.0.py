#String Testing

string = "Hello"
print(string[0])

# Since a string by deffinition is a list of characters, then I could use
# a string as a list to identify predifined mathematical expressions and
# instead of having the user enter choices for the type of expression, the
# user can enter the mathematical expression separated by mathematical
# operators (*, /, +, -, ^) and my program will recognize it using if statements
